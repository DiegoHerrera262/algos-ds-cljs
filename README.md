# algos-ds-clj

Repo for documenting my process on learning algorithms and data structures with clojure.

## Usage

For contributing, simply create a namespace that groups related functions to an algorithm technique, data structure or problem, with the corresponding tests namespace. The tests should:

* Cover relevant cases in unit tests
* Cover a relevant portion of the problem space using property testing

## TODO

* Add test coverage checks
* Add test run check
